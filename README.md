# Project Objective
This project aims to create a Basic Calculator using C++ that can handle both simple and advanced mathematical operations. This calcutor is designed with modularity in mind, ensuring that each operation is encapsulated in its own function. The project includes the following features:
* Basic Operation: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
* Advanced Operations: Exponentiation, square root, cube root
* Expression Evaluation: Evaluate complex mathematical expressions
* Calculation History: Track all calculations performed during a session
* Unit Conversion: Convert between units like Fahrenheit to Celsius, and kilometers to miles

  The main focus of this project is to demonstrate the effective use of C++ fundamentals such as:
  * Control Structures ( if/else,switch)
  * Modular function design
  * Error handling and debugging
  * Console input/output
  * Standard library functions (<cmath>, <vector>, <sstream>)
This project follows best practices in trems of coding conventions and structure, making it easy to read, maintain, and extend.
